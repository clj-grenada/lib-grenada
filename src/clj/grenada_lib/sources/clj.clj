;; Attention when changing the code:
;;
;; If you don't know about Maven dependency resolution and wonder why we're
;; doing things the way we're doing them, go away and read and understand
;; everything before you change anything. Especially you need to understand why
;; we feed all the depspecs to resolve-specs at once and why this is absolutely
;; necessary. In short, it is absolutely necessary, because the Maven dependency
;; resolution mechanism needs to see all the dependencies together in order to
;; work correctly. If you run it with some dependencies first and then with some
;; other dependencies and then just concat the resulting collections of files,
;; you will likely end up with two versions of the same artifact on the
;; classpath. And not notice it. â€“ Very bad.
;;
;; About the implementation:
;;
;; The SystemClassLoader is able to load anything from the classpath and will do
;; so if you ask it. We don't want do have any other files than those specified
;; in our Clojure runtime, since that might result in the wrong files being
;; scraped. Thus, when constructing the URLClassLoader, we can't let it use the
;; default parent, since that would most likely be the SystemClassLoader.
;; Therefore we use the parent of the SystemClassLoader, which doesn't load
;; anything from the classpath.
;;
;; Now, however, we can't just :import
;; org.projectodd.shimdandy.ClojureRuntimeShim and use
;; ClojureRuntimeShim/newRuntime. It would be loaded with Clojure's
;; ContextClassLoader and internally load ClojureRuntimeShimImpl loaded by our
;; custom URLClassLoader and try to upcast that to ClojureRuntimeShim. That
;; wouldn't work, because ClojureRuntimeShim and ClojureRuntimeShimImpl would
;; have been loaded by different classloaders. Cross-ClassLoader casting is not
;; possible. Therefore we use our custom URLClassLoader to load both
;; ClojureRuntimeShim and ClojureRuntimeShimImpl, which is why we have to do
;; some reflection stuff.
;;
;; TODO: Provide a slot for some little extractor library. Of course it can be
;;       included in the files, but it would be better to make it official and
;;       warn people not to introduce dependencies that would scramble up
;;       everything. (RM 2015-06-19)

  IMPORTANT NOTE: Ignore the following paragraph. What is written there will be
  supported again in a similar way. Right now, however, WHERE-TO-LOOK must be a
  Leiningen-style dependency spec.

  WHERE-TO-LOOK can either be a JAR File or a directory File. If it is a
  directory, it has to be the root of the tree of Clojure files to scan. That
  means, if you want to extract metadata from cool/namespace.clj, you can't just
  provide /path/to/cool/namespace.clj. You have to provide /path/to/ (including
  the trailing slash!), because otherwise Clojure won't be able to find the
  file. Don't ask me why. If it is required that you only extract metadata from
  that one namespace, send me a message and I will figure it out. Of course you
  can modify the graph to include a filter, but then it's your responsibility,
  not mine. I warned you.

  READ THE FOLLOWING! or you're in for trouble.

  If the artifact you want to extract metadata from is some version of Clojure
  itself, you have to provide the same version of Clojure in CLJ-DEPSPEC.
  Otherwise there is no guarantee that you will be extracting the right things.
  Right now, we don't check if you obey this rule and it is detrimental to you
  if you don't. So make extra sure you specified the right things.

  Extracting metadata from versions of Clojure before 1.7.0-RC1 is not supported
  yet."

;;; Notes:
;;;
;;;  - If I write, "see the code", I deem the code so straighforward that it

;;;
;;;  - If you replace a node (function) A in the graph with a node A' that
;;;    fulfils the replacement requirements of the A, you can be pretty sure
;;;    that the rest of the code will still work. Of course you can choose not
;;;    to fulfil the replacement requirements. But then you have to analyse
;;;    which nodes depended on A and change them accordingly.
;;;
;;;  - If I write, "Replacement: probably not necessary", I think that it
;;;    wouldn't make much sense to replace that particular node and thus don't
;;;    provide replacement requirements. If you find a case where you want to
;;;    replace the node after all, please contact me and I will provide
