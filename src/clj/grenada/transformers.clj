;; Note: You might be wondering about the extra check in the
;;       calling-transformer. lein-grim provides us with Things that have
;;       :arglists even though their :type is :var. Example: in-ns. This is
;;       because its type recognition mechanism is a bit primitive. I don't want
;;       to patch over this inconsistency; it has to be solved at its root.
;;       Therefore, if a Thing as :arglists, but is of :type :var, we just drop
;;       the :arglists information. calling-transformer has to make sure that it
;;       only returns something for Things with Aspects ::a/fn, ::a/macro or
;;       ::a/special.
