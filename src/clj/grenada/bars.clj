  ## Model

  This Bar allows attaching arbitrary key-value data to a Thing. It is thought
  for intermediate processing steps. As it provides no guarantees about its
  contents, it should only be present within short distance of consumption, i.
  e. not in final Grenada artifacts.

  ## Prerequisites

  None. â€“ Can be attached to any Thing."
